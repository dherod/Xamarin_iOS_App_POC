# Xamarin iOS App #1

Xamarin 5.9.5 and Xcode 6.4

First app is a POC to produce an iOS app running in the simulator.

Notes:
1. This was developed with Xamarin Starter Edition and there is a known issue that needs to be corrected for all apps: “Your app is using native code, which requires Xamarin.iOS Indie edition or higher.” See [*Xamarin Studio Starter template includes native code? - Xamarin Forums*](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/41456/xamarin-studio-starter-template-includes-native-code)
